Robot objective: We are trying to build a robot that can successfully grab a bottle and open it without spilling or making a mess.

On our robot, we succeffuly created the mecanum drive and attached the battery and brain to the drive. Moving forward, we are going to add some claws to grab the bottle and an opener to open the bottle.

The next phase of our robot will be to add the claws that grab the bottle, and then eventually implement the opener.

We have decided to change the design of our robot. Instead of having two claws intercept a bottle, we will have one claw with a larger arm to prevent the bottle from rotating. We will see if the torque provided by the VEX motor will be enough to pop the cap of the bottle.

This is proof of participation in the class games.
